Kahoot styled app create with NextJS & NestJS stack. The application allows you to create and solve simple quizzes based on a point system. Each question can have an unlimited number of answers. In the current version we propose to create only entertainment quizzes.

The entire application is based on docker containers. 
Simply run the command 

``` docker compose up --build ```.

The application consists of 4 containers:
- Backend - contains a container with NestJS (node 18)
- Frontend - contains a container with NextJs (node 18)
- Postres - contains a container with Postres
- Pgadmin4 - contains a container with PGAdmin.

In addition, the database was created using TypeOrm ensuring a faster start-up of the custom instance. 

For the development of applications or the creation of your own Frontend on port 3000, there is API (Swagger) documentation in /api
